# 01-Homework-Refactor
a repository for assignment #1 Homework.
It contains code for a web app.
I changed the css and html to implement semantic structure and make the code more readable.
I also fixed a few broken elements in the app.
I modified existing code, rather then building the application from scratch, as per the assignment requirements.
